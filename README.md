# DNATranslationTool
Native Python tools for translating DNA sequences to resulting proteins.

# Tasks

- DNA as a string (create base pair sequence translation)
- Convert the original String to the opposing strand
- Turn DNA(both strands) into RNA
- RNA to Codons
- Reading frame needs to be set (From the beginning move forward until we find our start codon) 
- Codons into Protein
